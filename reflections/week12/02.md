# Daily Reflection
Two full days in! Did you make the progress you were hoping for yesterday and today? How are you working? Client -> Server, focusing only on the server for now?  

Got my duck. Ready to get career stuff done. Not getting as much career stuff done, honestly having a hard time getting motivation after accomplishing the thing. 

## Prompts
- How is today going? 
- Are you managing your stress?
- What has you most worried?
