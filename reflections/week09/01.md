## Questions

1. What technologies and principles are you using in your project?

we are using [sockets, watcheffects, chartJS, OOP, SOLID, MVS, node, vue]

2. What went well so far?

We have completed what we would consider the MVP. We are now adding cool things and making things function better. 

3. What would you do differently? Why?

We would have made a day tracking schema. We thought about doing so earlier and pushed away from it. It would provide us with the data we need to make a line chart we spent all day not making.
