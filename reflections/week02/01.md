## Questions

1. What is Scope ?
scope is where i can be used. if you define a variable in a function it's scope is within that function very small scope. you can define a variable outside of function and magically it is global scope. 
2. What is Hoisting ?
when you hoist up a variable that is later defined but it is carried up with a value of undefind. unless it is a let variable then it is a reference error. 
3. In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?
 I wont use Var but basically it can be redeclared and reassigned. Const is a constant so if i don't want to change that variable thats my boy. Let is adjustable so if i'm going to cause trauma doing manipulations thats my B.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

jeremy helped with with this javascript function. basically we combined my add 3 point function to my add 1 point function. we did this by when invoking the function on html we are sending in a number to be used in the function. this way we didn't need 2 (later 3 when reducing point) we could just send in 1, 3, (-1). pretty sweet stuff. made me feel smart when he showed me one case this worked and i figured out how to do it with the other.
