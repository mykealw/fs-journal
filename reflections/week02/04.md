## Questions

1. What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?
 failure to plan is planning to fail. I believe heavily in the act of planning, but not on plans. I think the act of walking through the major steps of a project are nice while not getting bogged down in the details. 

2. How do you find answers when you are stuck?
    At first I groan, very loudly. That doesn't solve anything but is a necessary part. Then I look at my notes, then I walk around for 3 minutes and usually do a few push ups. Then I ask myself what am i trying to do. what can i do, or have i seen done (and understood) and then I try to scrap that together. If that fails google or go to harrison/TA/other instructor. 

3. From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?

measuring code progress my lines is like measuring plane building by weight. basically bigger isn't better, better is better. better is legible, simple. plan code and see where that takes you. don't think of the frills until you got the basics done.
