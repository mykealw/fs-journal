> **ðŸ“– [Callback Hell](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk4/01-Callbacks)**

## Questions

1. What are some of the signs and causes of `Callback Hell`?
causes, people like to think of their code being executed top down. the pyramid of a bunch of closing brackets parenthesis etc. 

2. What does the asynchronous mean and how are callbacks involved?

asynchronous means that we are doing a function and expect something not now but in the FUTURE!! 

3. Summarize the 3 ways to avoid / fix `Callback Hell`
1- keep code shallow - name your functions, makes more readable and breaks things up. don't nest things
2 - modularize - break things up into small single purpose things. 
3 - handle your errors - make first argument an error.
