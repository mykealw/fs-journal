## Questions

1. What is the purpose of `Async`/`Await`?

They (async/await) were created to be an improvment on promises. Promises had a purpose, but were crap. promises then catches and thens. So they come along and simplyfiy the code by making it look synchronous. This also helped with blocking. 

2. What must you do in order to  `await` a promise inside of a function?

You have to mark it as an async function. If you persist it won't work and will inform you that you are using a reserved word "await".

3. What are some of the primary benefits of `Async`/`Await`?

Less complex code - looks more like sychronous code 
Easier debugging - compiler treats like normal code. 
Does all the things - can accomplish everything that old promises could do.

double API's are sweet, I am looking forward to building a server. I have an old macbook and I want to make it into a server. I want to then use that server to work on projects. That will be my first week after codeworks if not employed. #goals. The more we go through the class the more ideas I have to pursue. I entered wanting a skill and am having feelings of inspiration and passion?
