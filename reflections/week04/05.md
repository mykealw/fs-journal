# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?



So, overall the project went well. I had one HUGE roadblock which was ultimately discovered to be that I had an ID tag I never recall making. It took me ~6 hours to solve it. I was beyond upset by the time I got it figured out. I solved what I thought was the problem 5 times 3 different ways. I can laugh about it now, but at the time-- despair! There are a few things I want to ask about with the checkpoint.
