## Questions

1. What is the purpose of Encapsulation?

to bundle data and methods so that access to that is restricted. aka code laundering. Let me explain that better, money laundering is when you try to obscure illegally gained money (sell drugs, fencing stolen goods, murder for hire) so you pass it through an intermediary (which you can control, but the best are when you do not control them but trust among criminals is ehh, which is why this is expensive) when it passes through this intermediary, it is "legit" earned income that you can then pay taxes on and the IRS can suck a fart. In code laundering the IRS is the end user who we don't want to know what all is going on under the hood. 

2. What were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix?

awkward and controversial. some new developers do not use them, some choose not to use them. so the human inconsistency factor is the issue. 

3. How do we create private variables in a ES6 Class? Why would you do this?

put in a class constructor, and use setters and getters. you would do this because it mimics having a private variable.
