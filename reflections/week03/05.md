I watched the videos on sunday and that helped A LOT. I would suggest the next class be told it is required prior to monday. Feel good going into the checkpoint. Haven't typed a line of code yet, but i know the road block will be check boxes with memory. Check boxes is something we haven't gone over. My current plan is to pretend they dont exist get everything else working comeback and take down goliath. I am choosing this method for anxiety reasons. Instead of getting caught up doing what I dont know i'm going to knock rest out and then all i have to do is revise to the standards. Wish me luck.
