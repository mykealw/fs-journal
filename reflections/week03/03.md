## Questions

1. What are the two common operations that we will set in the handler?

get and set

2. What do you have to make sure you are doing with every Get to ensure the value does not become `undefined`?

the get operater needs two parameters the object and the property being accessed

3. What are some of the benefits of the proxy object that we are using in our structure for applications?

allows to make information private. By that we set a "trap" and if they do not have an id for example we throw an error at them.
