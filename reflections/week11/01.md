## Questions

1. What does Inheritance accomplish for us in C#?

Inheritance is a mechanism to describe a relationship between two classes. Inheritance can also be used to imprint identitny into a class. (like extending email on account, from base profile.)

2. How does Member inheritance work in C#? Does a class inherit all members of the base class?

the child or derived class inherits all the methods of the base or parents class methods, even without declaring them. Constructors are not inherited THey also don't get finalizers??. 

3. How does accessibility affect inheritance?

private access modifier doesn't get passed down, unless it is nested in the parent class. It didn't go into how nested classes work.
