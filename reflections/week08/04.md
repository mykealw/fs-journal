## Questions

1. What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?

unit testing smallest of the bunch tests each function basically, sometimes parts of a function
componet testing tests each larger part of a app
end to end testing testing whole app


2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?

They are all helpful, most helpful ultimately is end to end, it shows the whole thing works.

3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?

They are all helpful, the least helpful is ultimately end to end, if something isn't working you have a lot more to analyze (i said it was both most and least lol)
