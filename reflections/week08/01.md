There are several reasons, but basically it is a way to show that you have some authority on the subject. It can help your brand, and advertise you to employers.

Showcases and sets you a apart for recruiters to see. Shows your variety of skills and allows you to shine. 

3. What projects do you have that you would include in your Portfolio? Why?

I would include my event tower. It looks the best, and I got a lot of the stretch goals on it. Also I am really proud of that work. I just worked it from back to front and added feature as needed. I didn't realize some of the things I did were stetch goals. I had a lot of fun with it as well.
