## Questions

1. What are the three types of relationships?

one-to-one (1:1)
one-to-many (1:N)
many-to-many (N:M)

2. What are the benefits of the traditional `linking` of relationships instead of `Embedding`

Embedding it allows access to information with only 1 request. However sometimes what you are embedding can become too big. This is why linking is good. Then there is seperation and visibility. 


3. What are some of the challenges faced when deciding how to manage a many-to-many relationship that ultimately drive your decision on how to create it?

Basically is is a numbers game. You have to realize how big N and M are and make design decision based off of that.
