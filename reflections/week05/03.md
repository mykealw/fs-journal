## Questions

1. In simple terms what is timeboxing?

Time boxing is a time management strategy where you assign time limits to tasks/activities. This serves as a deadline so ADHD folks like me feel the adreneline and the urgency of acting kicks in. Helps breaks parkinsons law. 

2. What three strategies will you implement and how?

Swallow the frog, once you get the crap out of the way it is all down hill. 
Golden hour know you and know when you kick butt. 
remove distractions. Hide the phone. 

3. Give an example of when you would have benefitted from timeboxing and how? 

I like to gym. When my schedule is tight, I put gym last thing to do. This way I am motivated to get through the stuff I dont want, because if i fail to what I lose is sleep or gym both of which I value.
