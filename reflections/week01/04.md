## Questions

1. What is the purpose of wire-framing? 

wire framing is a low cost and quick way to get all parties-- developers, stakeholders, clients etc -- to approve of an idea before you put in work.

2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?
low mid and high fidelity. They are useful for different parts of development. A low is little more than a thumb sketch, which is where you start a foundation for a project. Mid and high have increasingly more detail and are for vetting design ideas before code is put to computer screen. high is basically the end product still in mock up, where the idea is finalized and ready for commission.  

3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?

hell yes, abraham lincoln said that if he had an hour to chop a tree he would spend 50 minutes of it sharpening an ax. do the work that sets you up for success, and prevents you from doing excess work.
