## Questions

1. What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use

psuedo classes are things that exist on elements  but are not elements themselves. some common ones I will use is hover and active because I dislike that color of purple. 

2. What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?

specificity is a measurement of priority of applying a style in css. sometimes there will be conflicting styles for an element, the one with the higher specificity wins, unless important tags come into play.

3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?

The only way to defeat an important tag is to use another important tag. However when you run into issues and everything is important it is hard to fix things. Too many importants in the kitchen.
