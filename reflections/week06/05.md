# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

I just now found out no one reads these. I have done them so far so might as well keep doing it. I had a lot of struggles with vue this week. The videos not working, monday was a cluster. I learned a lot from this checkpoint. I think I learned as much from this one as I did from the first task master. I like and hate vue. Some things are cool, others are not complicated but just not the formula I am used to. I see why people use them recycling is cool. As I get better and dont have to log every variable as it passes through a function (i used to use debugger but frameworks can make that hell.) is tedious but I want to make sure the function is working as intended and it is the way of checking values. Anyways I expect my 5th duck. I had a lot of fun I sat down 12 hours ago and more or less haven't moved and I'm not angry. I had success, sometimes few and far between other times I was on a roll. I feel confident about the gauntlet.
