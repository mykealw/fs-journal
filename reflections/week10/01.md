## Questions

1. What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?

Value type - holds a value ie string bool int
Reference Type - stores the reference where value is stored
PointerType - they don't do things?

2. What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?

they are a lot more specific and strict
bool string char int (and its brothers)

3. In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?

They have an address, the address tells where to find it. Values the value is on hand so it is there for it.
