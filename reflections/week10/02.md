## Questions

1. What is a List in C#?

A list is very similar to an Array in JS, however they can only hold 1 data type. No Pojos here. 

2. What List methods seem like you might use them often? Why?

index, add, contains, exists, find, findall. These are all methods that are similar to ones I either used in JS or wish JS had. 

3. How would you retrieve an item from a list? What method could you use?

index of to find an item then list[index] to have its value. Honestly C# provides many ways to do this.
