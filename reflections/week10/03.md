## Questions

1. In a SQL table, what is the difference between information in a row and information in a column?

row is an entry, column is all the data of that type across all entries. 

2. Demonstrate the basic structure for creating a new table called `characters` with the values `name, age, description` as strings, and an `int` id.

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS characters(
    id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL primary key COMMENT 'primary key',
    name varchar(255) COMMENT 'User Name',
    age varchar(255) COMMENT 'User Email',
    description varchar(255) COMMENT 'User Picture'
) default charset utf8 COMMENT '';

3. What are the difference between the following statements: 
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name;
DROP TABLE table_name;
```
the bottom one (drop) deltes the table, the top one (delete) deletes the data from the table. big difference.
