# Advanced Front-End Frameworks


**1.** Describe the two ways to bind Data in Vue?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
v-model
v-bind for 2 way binding

```

**2.** The `SPA` acronym stands for what?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
S -single
P -page
A -application

```
**3.** What are some of the advantages/uses of a `SPA` over a traditional one?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Some of the better advantages of SPA is it is a better UI experience. SPA's more similarly perform like apps and that is how we have been condiditoned to experience digital things. 

```
**4.** What does the `onMounted` method in Vue do?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
On mount is very similar to our constructor we had in the past. By that I mean it fires off and executes the code when the new "page" is mounted. 

```
**5.** What is the `v-model` attribute in Vue for, and when might you use it?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
The v-model is to bind data.properties to objects. I use this a lot when making edits, or creating new objects.

```
**6.** The `v:on` (`@`) directive can be used for what?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
These without our framework were called onclick. Now it is @click, which just 1- more readable 2-looks cooler. 

```
**7.** Which Vue attributes(directives) could you use to conditionally render elements on a page?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
v-if
v-if-else
v-else

```
**8.** What is the purpose of the `key` attribute when using `v-for` on an element?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
The purpose of the key is to tell what makes each object unique. We often use Id's because Id's should be by their nature unique. 

```
**9.** What is the `<slot>` element and what is it used for?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
The slot element is used for off-canvas's and modals. Essentially it allows us to reuse componets by sliding code into those slots. This allows them to be reusable because 1 modal can have unlimited calls to using slots.
