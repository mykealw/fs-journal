the controller is what the answer used to be, I'm not sure if frameworks change things.

**2.** What is the difference between a vue `component` and `page`?

A page is the total application currently on the routerview (often times made of many componets). A componet is a self sufficient element that can be displayed on the page.

**4.** What are the three tags that make up a Vue component?

**5.** What does the `L` represent in the `SOLID` principles?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Liskov Substitution Principle, good think his name wasn't Albert, too many vowels in a row. This principle is by far the hardest to understand. The best explaination I have found is, it's an extension of open-closed principle, as itâ€™s a way of ensuring that derived classes extend the base class without changing behavior.

```
**6.** Which component in Vue does the vue-router use to mount pages onto?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
I'm not sure what exactly this is asking. I am going to make a long explaination of what I think this is ask. Vue displays on the Vue.app. At that level you can place elements that will always be on the screen. Navbars, and other elements like a fab (floating action button) are examples. On that page there is also the router-view. On the router-view we display pages, like shows on a tv. There is a router js file that directs the router view to the right url, like flipping channels on a tv. The answer is somewhere in there, I hope. 
```
**7.** What is the difference between the `AppState` and the state object within a component?

SCOPE! appState is global, the state is local.

```
**9.** What is the responsibility of `Services` in our Vue projects?

add scope makes it limited to the page.

```
