# Working in a Professional Environment

**1.** What is Inheritance?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```

```
**2.** What is the `Singleton` design pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
A single instantiantion of a class, but many instances of an object. This reduced the need of global variables, and keeps namespace open. 
```
**3.** What is the `Observer` design pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Objects "subscribe" to an event and are notified when an event changes. Proxystate for example when we did the oldschool js without framework. 

```
**4.** What is the `Strategy` design pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Haven't heard of this one before? Anyhow it is when an algorithm is fired off which from my understand is just a series of functions getting fired off in a chain reaction. 

```
**5.** What is the `Factory` design pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
The factory pattern is a creational design pattern that provides a generic interface for creating objects. In the factory pattern, we can specify the type of object being created and we do not need to explicitly require a constructor. If there is an issue you just fix it in the factory?
```
**6.** What is test driven development?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
You write a test for your code to pass. You make your code pass the test. You refactor your code, you make a new test. This is a type of development that coding, testing, development are interwoven. 

```
**7.** In Scrum/Agile what is the DoD?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```

Definition of Done. functional, tested, polished. all are different defintions of done. 

```
**8.** Give two examples of a user story:
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
1) as a user I want to be able to see all the events I am attending, and cancel if I change my mind.
2) as a user I want to be able to see my progress over the last 2 weeks, as well as get details on specific days. 
```
**9.** During which ceremony is your Sprint Backlog created?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
ceremony # 2 (i'm more a fan of mambo #5) the sprint planning. This is where you plan what will  be accomplished in the sprint, so making the backlog then makes a lot of sense.
```
**10.** In which of these ceremonies are Tasks assigned to you?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Daily Scrum when you say what you are going to work on that day. That is ceremony #3.
